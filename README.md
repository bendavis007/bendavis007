- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Davis.
- 👀 I’m interested in astrophysics.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching black hole mass scaling relations, the structure/dynamics of galaxies, galaxy evolution, intermediate-mass black holes, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that compare galaxy simulations to real galaxies and help bridge the gap. 
- 📫 You can reach me at ben.davis@nyu.edu.
